title_txt: "Carelynn's Super Cool Page of Super Cute Animals"

description: "This is Carelynn's first page created with her own layout. This is going to be a page with pictures of cute animals and fun facts because she doesn't really know what else to do. Carelynn is a person who like cute animals. She has two bunnies named Poppy and Hazel, and also wants a dog."

elephant: 
  name: "Rockcrusher"
  image: "/assets/site/images/elephant.jpg"
  description : "Rockcrusher is an elephant. She like mudbaths and grass"
  content: "The elephants are the large mammals forming the family Elephantidae in the order Proboscidea. Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons."

bunny:
  name: "Ball"
  image: "/assets/site/images/bunny.jpg"
  description: "Ball is a bunny. Ball is antisocial and likes bananas."
  content: "Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha (along with the hare and the pika). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes thirteen wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and as a source of artistic inspiration."

dog:
  name: "Cheeseburger"
  image: "/assets/site/images/dog.jpg"
  description: "Cheeseburger is a dog. He is shy around strangers, but is a very happy canine around friends."
  content: "The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviours, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."

dolphin:
  name: "Steve"
  image: "/assets/site/images/dolphin.jpg"
  description: "Steve is a dolphin. He likes to show off his jumping skills, and catches fish by making mud nets."
  content: "Dolphin is a common name of aquatic mammals within the order Cetacea, arbitrarily excluding whales and porpoises. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at 55.5 km/h (34.5 mph). Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water."

lion: 
  name: "Simba"
  image: "/assets/site/images/lion.jpg"
  description: "Simba has a live-action film coming out this Summer on July 19, 2019"
  content: "Born a prince in the Pride Lands, Simba was destined to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king. When Mufasa is killed in an apparent accident, Simba is blamed for the tragedy and abandons his kingdom in guilt, leaving his power-hungry uncle to assume the throne. With the Pride Lands falling to disarray under Scar's tyranny, Simba is forced to take his rightful place in the Circle of Life by confronting his past and reclaiming his birthright. Upon entering adulthood, Simba marries his childhood best friend, Nala, and has two cubs with her named Kiara and Kion."
